# Fundraising

Raising funds from community members 

grunt currently uses the [CanadaHelps](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/grunt-gallery/) webpage to collect donations. Annual giving drives can funnel clicks to the grunt CanadaHelps webpage.

Locally-developed [Keela nonprofit CRM](https://www.keela.co/) can activate community and community giving in new ways. Keela integrates with MailChimp, Eventbrite, Quickbooks, and Stripe, but Keela comes with a annual charge. If the benefits of using a not-for-profit CRM outweigh the annual charge, it might be worth considering.
