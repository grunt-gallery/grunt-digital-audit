# Web Servers

grunt uses [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) Shared Web Hosting for primary hosting and [Whirl-i-gig](https://www.collectiveaccess.org/services/) for hosting the archive site.

Many of grunt's websites use [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as a CMS, while the [archive site](https://archives.grunt.ca/) uses [CollectiveAccess](https://www.collectiveaccess.org/) as a CMS.

### Shared Hosting

Shared hosting allows multiple websites to use or "share" a single server. Users of shared hosting services do not know what other websites the resources are shared with. Each user has a limit on the amount of server resources they can use.

Shared hosting is the cheapest hosting option because it comes with certain limitations.

### Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting pools computing resources from a network of virtual and physical servers, which allows for scalability and flexibility in arranging computing resources. Cloud hosting is pay-as-you-go which means computing resources can be added, increased, or scaled back as-needed.

### grunt's Server Mix

grunt uses shared hosting with DreamHost and a cloud hosting subscription that is managed by Whirl-i-gig (CollectiveAccess).

## Web Maintenance

Maintenance of the servers is important. For the archive servers, Whirl-i-gig handles updates and maintenance as part of the hosting package. They also do nightly backups of the data on the CollectiveAccess installation.

DreamHost shared hosting requires maintenance, especially as DreamHost limits PHP versions to current versions only, which makes legacy websites break.

DreamHost does this in order to charge extra for hosting legacy websites, currently ~$5 USD extra per website per month.

The cost of keeping a legacy websites online can be estimated by calculating the cost of upgrading the site to a current PHP version ($X software developer cost) vs. ~$5 USD per month x the # of months of the site's useful life.

These costs can also be used when evaluating whether a website is to be hosted online or archived.
