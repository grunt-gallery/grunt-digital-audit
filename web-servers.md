In 2023, SFU Galleries engaged an external consultant to review their digital landscape and processes. The goal was to identify risks and opportunities for growth and community engagement. This assessment focuses on inclusion and accessibility. This work is ongoing. It will constantly shift as technology develops and as SFU Galleries' audience changes. This is a snapshot of a moment in time to provide insight into barriers present in existing processes. It is not a critique on those who are currently engaged in this work, nor those who created it. This report is written from an outside perspective. It both highlights opportunities for change, and identifies barriers that may not be possible to remove with the resources currently available to SFU Galleries. The knowledge gained from this report is equally important as solving conflicts or crossing items off a list. When we are made aware of barriers, we better see those who are struggling. We can have more informed conversations and moments for inclusion, even when the temptation is to “fix” a problem and check it off a list.

Translating contemporary art and concepts into writing requires abstract and complex language. This report presents an opportunity for decision-makers to consider who they are speaking to and who is their primary audience. Formal style guides will promote better communication with primary audiences and create a resource for staff to keep writing consistent and on-brand.
