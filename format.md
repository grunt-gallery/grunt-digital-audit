# Format

The deliverable format for this report is a git repository. 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system for the management of computer files. Git tracks changes that are made to files so as to coordinate the work of contributors who are working collaboratively. A [git repository](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-a-git-repository) is a folder of computer files that is managed by git, so that multiple contributors can access and make changes to the files in a way that is structured, traceable, and secure.

Although there is only one author of this report, the idea is to put into place collaborative working methods that can expand over time to give proper credit to all those who choose contribute to grunt's digital tools. There are also many past contributors to grunt's public-facing digital tools who are only partially acknowledged through comments made to the code base.

Git is offered under the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) — a free and open-source software license — and works on all major computer operating systems.
