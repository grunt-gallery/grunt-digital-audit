# Format

The deliverable format for this report is a git repository. 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system for the management of computer files. Git tracks changes that are made to files so as to coordinate the work of multiple contributors working collaboratively. 

A [git repository](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-a-git-repository) is a folder of computer files managed by git, such that multiple contributors can access and make changes to files without overwriting one another.

Although there is only one author to this report, the idea behind it is to put into place collaborative working methods which can expand over time to allow for multiple contributors.

There are many past contributors to grunt's public-facing digital assets who are only partially acknowledged through code comments—which are not easily accessible. Recognizing the work of contributors through mentions, links, and commit history better-rewards the contributions made to grunt's digital ecosystem.

Git is offered under the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) — a free and open-source software license — and works on all major computer operating systems.
