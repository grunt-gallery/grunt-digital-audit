The SFU Galleries (SFUG) Arts Workers tag includes those who work behind the scenes at the gallery and who carry out much of the inclusion work. It also includes artists who work as content producers, workshop facilitators, or featured artists in exhibitions. Staff and arts workers are often overlooked in access reporting, perpetuating ableism within gallery systems and services. SFU Galleries must hire, sustain, and support Disabled workers or workers living with disabilities in their staff, or lose the chance to benefit from a rich pool of potential workers and miss out on informed and authentic conversations with their audiences. The goal is not simply to serve inclusively but to be inclusive.

The SFUG Audience tag contains the public audiences SFU Galleries serves by holding events, exhibitions, and arts programming. This audience wants to attend the gallery or programming for their purposes. They are non-academic and may or may not have an arts background, although they are interested in arts and culture. This audience includes non-SFU education contacts, such as teachers and students from other schools.

The SFUG Network tag includes Simon Fraser University students, teachers, and departments. It will also include work and interactions related to the Public Art on campus in Burnaby.
