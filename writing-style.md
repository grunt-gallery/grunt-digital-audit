# Writing Style

This report uses a social language writing style. grunt sits at the intersection of the academic world, the fine arts community, and the public. It is best to consider the audience with the most challenges and centre them when building access into policy. While universal access is not possible, it is always the goal. This report aims for a grade 10/11 reading level and 60% on the Flesch Reading Ease to strike a balance between accessible and professional. A grade 9 reading level is the recommended reading level when writing content for the web.

Translating contemporary art and concepts into writing requires abstract and complex language. This report presents an opportunity for decision-makers to consider who they are speaking to and who is their primary audience. Formal style guides will promote better communication with primary audiences and create a resource for staff to keep writing consistent and on-brand.
