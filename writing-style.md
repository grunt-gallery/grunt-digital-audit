# Writing Style

While universal access is not possible, it is a goal. This report uses a non-academic writing style that aims for a grade 10/11 reading level. A grade 9 reading level is the recommended reading level when writing content for the web.

All pages of this report have been passed through [Readable.com](https://readable.com/features/#readability) and [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to improve readability and access.

Translating contemporary art and concepts into writing sometimes requires abstract and complex language. This report presents an opportunity for decision-makers to consider who they are speaking to and who is their primary audience. 

Having a formal style guide will promote better communication with primary audiences and create a resource for staff, to keep writing consistent. A style guide such as this could be published and made public, so that audience communities can understand grunt's objectives as such a guide would be sure to and change over time. 

While most free online style guide resources will reference "brand" and "brand message", these words are essentially synonomous with "organisation" and "organisational values".
