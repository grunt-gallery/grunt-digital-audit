## Impressions

The Mount Pleasant Community Art Screen is a standalone WordPress website at the URL [mpcas.ca](https://www.mpcas.ca/).

Below are some initial impressions of the site:

- From the URL and landing page it is not clear that grunt manages the digital screen or the website. If a subdomain were used, it would be more clear that grunt manages the digital screen. 

- The video that plays on the landing page does not give context to what the project is or where it is located—apart from the name "Mount Pleasant" in the video title—but one would need to be familiar with Vancouver to understand that Mount Pleasant is a neighbourhod in Vancouver.

- The screening schedule is not accurate (this was tested by going to the screen at the time a work supposed to be played on the screen, but it was not being played).

- The [past works page](https://www.mpcas.ca/past-works/) only displays some of the past works. 
- Artist pages are not easily found or organised according to artist *and* artist work.

- There is a [standalone app that pulls data directly from the screen player](https://www.files.mpcas.ca/) located at the site of the digital screen, but requests to that URL are currently blocked by CORS permissions which are not properly assigned. This causes the site to break. The app is also not advertised or linked anywhere, and so nobody would know that it exists.

- Acknowledgements to the project funders is not located in the footer of the site or on all pages. Goodwill for funding and managing the digital screen is being lost because of poor recognition placement.

## Discussion

This website could be better linked to grunt and the project funding partners. The schedule could be made to be accurate and/or pull data directly from the digital screen player, once the CORS permissions are modified. The player schedule could be made readable at the physical site of the screen with a QR code. 

The works shown on the screen could be better organised on the website, and the artist bios could be made more easily findable through an artist directory page.

The "many page" structure of the site could be made to have fewer pages, and the video on the landing screen could be removed or made relevant to the project.

The programming of MPCAS could be brought-in to the grunt.ca website in some way, to showcase it to the grunt.ca audience.
