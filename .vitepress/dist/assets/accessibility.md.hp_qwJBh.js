While Level AAA Success Criteria is a goal worth striving for, there are few developers practicing accessible code such that it conforms to these standards as it often is not a priority for non-Disabled and Hearing centered organizations and clients, and many prioritize functionality and access over design. Design firms themselves may say that they are working to support an accessible web, but unless asked, will not work higher than an A or AA level. As such many softwares and organizations are still using WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 to set their conformance goals, with a minimum level A conformance.</p><p>Mention creative access, accessibility as artistic practice.
