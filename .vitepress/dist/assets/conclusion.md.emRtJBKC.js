The goal was to identify risks and opportunities for growth and community engagement. This assessment focuses on inclusion and accessibility. This work is ongoing. It will constantly shift as technology develops and as SFU Galleries&#39; audience changes. This is a snapshot of a moment in time to provide insight into barriers present in existing processes. It is not a critique on those who are currently engaged in this work, nor those who created it. This report is written from an outside perspective. It both highlights opportunities for change, and identifies barriers that may not be possible to remove with the resources currently available to SFU Galleries. The knowledge gained from this report is equally important as solving conflicts or crossing items off a list. When we are made aware of barriers, we better see those who are struggling. We can have more informed conversations and moments for inclusion, even when the temptation is to “fix” a problem and check it off a list.</p><h2 id="presentation" tabindex="-1">Presentation <a class="header-anchor" href="#presentation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Presentation&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="writing-style" tabindex="-1">Writing Style <a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-style" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Writing Style&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This report uses a social language writing style. SFU Galleries sits at the intersection of the academic world, the fine arts community, and the public. It is best to consider the audience with the most challenges and centre them when building access into policy. While universal access is not possible, it is always the goal. This report aims for a grade 10/11 reading level and 60% on the Flesch Reading Ease to strike a balance between accessible and professional. A grade 9 reading level is the recommended reading level when writing content for the web.</p><p>SFU Galleries may feel pressure to communicate in more academic ways due to its connection to the University and the Fine Arts Community.</p><p>Translating contemporary art and concepts into writing requires abstract and complex language. This report presents an opportunity for decision-makers to consider who they are speaking to and who is their primary audience. Formal style guides will promote better communication with primary audiences and create a resource for staff to keep writing consistent and on-brand.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><h4 id="example-of-academic-language-in-a-report" tabindex="-1">Example of academic language in a report: <a class="header-anchor" href="#example-of-academic-language-in-a-report" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example of academic language in a report:&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Although the result of the study was inconclusive, it did confirm the writer&#39;s hypothesis and as such, the committee decided to implement the policy.</p><h4 id="example-of-social-writing-at-a-grade-9-level" tabindex="-1">Example of social writing at a grade 9 level: <a class="header-anchor" href="#example-of-social-writing-at-a-grade-9-level" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example of social writing at a grade 9 level:&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The result of the study confirmed the writer&#39;s hypothesis.
