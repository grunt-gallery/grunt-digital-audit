One consultant focused on measuring the accessibility of grunt&#39;s online presence while the other considered methods for archiving, maintaining and further developing grunt&#39;s public-facing digital infrastructure. The goal for both reports was to identify risks and opportunities for growth and community engagement amongst grunt&#39;s audiences.</p><p>This assessment focuses on maintaining and further developing grunt&#39;s public-facing digital infrastructure. The work in this area is ongoing and the planning needed to do this work will constantly shift as technology develops and as grunt&#39;s audiences change.</p><p>This report is a snapshot of a moment in time to provide insight into the barriers and challenges that are present in grunt&#39;s existing processes. It is not a critique of those who are currently engaged in this work, nor those who created grunt&#39;s public-facing digital assets.</p><p>This report is written from an outside perspective. It both highlights opportunities for change, and identifies barriers that may not be possible to remove with the resources currently available to grunt. The knowledge gained from this report is equally as important as solving problems or crossing &quot;todo&quot; items off of a list. When we are made aware of barriers, we can better see those who are struggling. We can have more informed conversations and moments for inclusion, even when the temptation is to “fix” a problem and check it off a list.</p><h2 id="presentation" tabindex="-1">Presentation <a class="header-anchor" href="#presentation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Presentation&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="writing-style" tabindex="-1">Writing Style <a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-style" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Writing Style&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This report uses a social language writing style. grunt sits at the intersection of the academic world, the fine arts community, and the public. It is best to consider the audience with the most challenges and centre them when building access into policy. While universal access is not possible, it is always the goal. This report aims for a grade 10/11 reading level and 60% on the Flesch Reading Ease to strike a balance between accessible and professional. A grade 9 reading level is the recommended reading level when writing content for the web.</p><p>Translating contemporary art and concepts into writing requires abstract and complex language. This report presents an opportunity for decision-makers to consider who they are speaking to and who is their primary audience. Formal style guides will promote better communication with primary audiences and create a resource for staff to keep writing consistent and on-brand.</p>',9),r=[o];function s(c,d,l,h,g,u){return t(),n("div",null,r)}const f=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
