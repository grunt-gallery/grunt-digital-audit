# Introduction

In 2023, grunt engaged two external consultants to review their digital landscape and processes. One consultant focused on measuring the accessibility of grunt's online presence while the other considered methods for archiving, maintaining and further developing grunt's public-facing digital infrastructure. The goal for both reports was to identify risks and opportunities for growth and community engagement amongst grunt's audiences. 

This assessment focuses on maintaining and further developing grunt's public-facing digital infrastructure. The work in this area is ongoing and the planning needed to do this work will constantly shift as technology develops and as grunt's audiences change. 

This report is a snapshot of a moment in time to provide insight into the barriers and challenges that are present in grunt's existing digital processes. It is not a critique of those who are currently engaged in this work, nor those who created grunt's public-facing digital assets. 

This report is written from an outside perspective. It both highlights opportunities for change, and identifies barriers that may not be possible to remove with the resources currently available to grunt. The knowledge gained from this report is equally as important as solving problems or crossing "todo" items off of a list. When we are made aware of barriers, we can better see those who are struggling. We can have more informed conversations and moments for inclusion, even when the temptation is to “fix” a problem and check it off a list.
