# GitHub

[Github](https://github.com/) is a free online platform that allows developers to create, store, and manage their code using git. 

GitHub is a low-barrier and accessible way to share code and manage multiple git projects between collaborators.

A GitHub account acts as a historical record for code changes, as well as a backup for code that is deployed elsewhere.

As a part of this project, a [GitHub organisation page](https://github.com/grunt-gallery) has been set-up for grunt.
