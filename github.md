# GitHub

[Github](https://github.com/) is a free online platform that allows developers to create, store, and manage their code using Git. 

GitHub is a low-barrier and accessible way to share code and manage multiple Git projects between collaborators.

A GitHub account simultaneously acts as a historical record for code changes, as a backup for code that is deployed elsewhere, and as a web server for files.

As a part of this project, a [GitHub organisation page](https://github.com/grunt-gallery) has been set up for grunt.

GitHub simultaneously hosts the code for making this report as well as acting as a webserver that allows you to read it now.
