# grunt.ca

[grunt's primary website](https://grunt.ca) is a legacy [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) website with a custom theme that has been in service for many years. From browsing the [grunt theme source code](https://github.com/grunt-gallery/grunt-wordpress-theme), it is clear that many developers have worked on the grunt.ca site over the last ten years. 

From a development perspective, the source code could be better organised and the style of code-writing could be made more consistent (this is likely a symptom of different developers working on the site).

In 2022 the author of this report was asked to improve the [grunt.ca](https://grunt.ca) site. The site was bumped to a current [PHP](https://www.php.net/) version and the [WordPress theme](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/themes/) stylesheet files were migrated from vanilla [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) to [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). As well, many redundant webpages were "pruned" from the database and some general housekeeping tasks were done on the WordPress backend.

The site was then put into a git repository and uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/grunt-gallery/grunt-wordpress-theme).
