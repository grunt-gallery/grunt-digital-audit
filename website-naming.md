# Website Naming
grunt currently uses many unique website names that all require registration and payment for upkeep.

While this web-naming practice gives uniqueness to a project, it adds financial, administrative, and possibly technical burdens to grunt.

Instead of registering multiple unique website names, this report recommends using a subdomain naming structure for all digital projects moving forward.

### What is a subdomain name?

A subdomain name is a piece of additional information added to the beginning of a website’s domain name. It allows websites to separate and organize content for a specific function — such as a blog, online store, or digital project — from the rest of the website.

This project is organized using a subdomain naming structure: https://digital-audit.grunt.ca/

The [digital-audit] portion of the URL in https://digital-audit.grunt.ca is a subdomain. 

:::

Subdomain disk space is kept entirely separate from the parent website files of the grunt.ca primary website, and the subdomain does not require any renewals or extra payments. 

Different permissions can be made to subdomains for security and to allow for additional users.

You can make as many subdomains as you want without incurring additional charges.

An additional benefit to the subdomain naming structure is that all subdomains will semantically reference the grunt.ca website and grunt as the manager of the website.
