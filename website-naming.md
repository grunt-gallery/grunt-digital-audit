# Website Naming

grunt currenly uses many unique website names that all require registration and payment for upkeep.

While this web-naming practice can give uniqueness to a project, it adds financial, administrative, and possibly technical burdens to grunt.

Instead, this report recommends using a subdomain naming structure for all digital projects going forward.

### What is a subdomain name?

A subdomain name is a piece of additional information added to the beginning of a website’s domain name. It allows websites to separate and organize content for a specific function — such as a blog, online store, or digital project — from the rest of the website.

:::

This project is organized using a subdomain naming structure: https://digital-audit.grunt.ca/

The [digital-audit] portion of the URL digital-audit.grunt.ca is a subdomain. 

The subdomain is kept entirely separate from the website files of the grunt.ca primary website, and the subdomain does not require any renewals or extra payments. 

You can make as many subdomains as you want without incurring additional charges.

An added benefit to the subdomain naming structure is that all subdomains semantically reference the grunt.ca website and grunt.
