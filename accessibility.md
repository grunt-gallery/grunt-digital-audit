No specific accessibility recommendations are made in this report.

Generally, this report recommends that all of grunt's public-facing digital assets aim to achieve compatibility with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 (June 2018)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), the [Accessible British Columbia Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/21019), and other best practice recommendations from Disability resources and communities. 

Accessibility laws are still in their infancy in Canada, and so the [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) and [American Accessibility Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/) can be used as "goalposts", while acknowledging that grunt is not *required* to conform to any best practices or accessibility standards per Canadian law. 

grunt can seek to make their digital offerings accessible to users first, while acknowledging that laws, regulations, and government policies are being developed and will require grunt to be more digitally accessible in the future. 

This report uses for a minimum conformance of [Level AA within the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) which is a foundational level of accessibility. While Level AAA Success Criteria is a goal worth striving for, there are few developers practicing accessible code such that it conforms to these standards as it often is not a priority for non-Disabled and Hearing centered organizations and clients, and many prioritize functionality and access over design. Design firms themselves may say that they are working to support an accessible web, but unless asked, will not work higher than an A or AA level. As such many softwares and organizations are still using WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 to set their conformance goals, with a minimum level A conformance.

Mention creative access, accessibility as artistic practice. Digital residency or project-based accessibility initiatives.
