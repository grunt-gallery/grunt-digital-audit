<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance" title="Explanation of WCAG 2 Level AA conformance" ><img height="32" width="88" src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/wcag2.1AA-v" alt="Level AA conformance, W3C WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1"></a>

Since online accessibility is being handled in a parallel report, no specific accessibility recommendations are made in this report.

More generally, this report recommends that all of grunt's public-facing digital assets aim to achieve compatibility with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 (June 2018)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), the [Accessible British Columbia Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/21019), and other best practice recommendations from Disability resources and communities. 

Accessibility laws are still in their early stages in Canada, and so the [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) and [American Accessibility Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/) can be used as "goalposts" when Canadian accessibility standards fall short. grunt is not yet *required* to conform to any best practices or accessibility standards as per Canadian law. 

grunt can still seek to make their digital offerings accessibility-focused while acknowledging that laws, regulations, and government policies are still being developed, and that grunt will be required to be more digitally accessible in the future. 

This report uses for a minimum conformance of [Level AA within the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) which is a basic level of accessibility.
